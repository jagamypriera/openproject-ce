OpenProject My Project Page PlugIn
==================================

This plugin provides a customizable view of the Project-Overview-Page, very similar
to the "My Page" in the OpenProject Core.

Requirements
------------

The My Project Page plugin currently requires the OpenProject Core in version 3.0.0 or newer.

Installation
------------

To install the My Project Page plugin, add the following line to the `Gemfile.plugins` to your OpenProject installation (if you use a different OpenProject version than OpenProject 5, adapt `:branch => "stable/5"` to your OpenProject version):

`gem "openproject-my_project_page", :git => "https://github.com/finnlabs/openproject-my_project_page.git", :branch => "stable/5"`

Afterwards, run:

`bundle install`

This plugin contains migrations. To migrate the database, run:

`rake db:migrate`

Deinstallation
--------------

Remove the line

`gem "openproject-my_project_page", :git => "https://github.com/finnlabs/openproject-my_project_page.git", :branch => "stable/5"`

from the file `Gemfile.plugins` and run:

`bundle install`

Please note that this leaves plugin data in the database. Currently, we do not
support full uninstall of the plugin.
