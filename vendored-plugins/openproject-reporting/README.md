OpenProject Reporting Plugin
=============================

The OpenProject Reporting plugin allows to create custom reports for costs associated to projects using the [OpenProject Costs plugin](https://community.openproject.org/projects/costs-plugin). Various attributes including custom fields can be used to filter the data and the results can be grouped by these attributes.

The OpenProject Reporting plugin is built on top of the [ReportingEngine Rails engine](https://community.openproject.org/projects/plugin-reportingengine), providing the base functionality for customized database reports.

Requirements
------------

The OpenProject Reporting plugin requires the [OpenProject Core](https://github.com/opf/openproject/) in
version greater or equal to *3.0.0*. It also requires the [ReportingEngine Rails engine](https://github.com/finnlabs/reporting_engine.git) in version greater or equal to *1.0.0*. Finally, it also requires the [OpenProject Costs plugin](https://github.com/finnlabs/openproject-costs.git).

Installation
------------

Reporting depends on the OpenProject Costs plugin. If you have not installed it yet, you can do so by adding the following line to the `Gemfile.plugins` in your OpenProject installation:

`gem "openproject-costs", git: "https://github.com/finnlabs/openproject-costs.git", :branch => "stable/5"`

Furthermore, OpenProject reporting depends on the ReportingEngine which should be installed by adding the following line to your `Gemfile.plugins` in your OpenProject installation folder:

`gem "reporting_engine", git: "https://github.com/finnlabs/reporting_engine.git", :branch => "dev"`

Finally, add the following line to your `Gemfile.plugins` in your OpenProject installation folder to use the Reporting plugin:

`gem "openproject-reporting", git: "https://github.com/finnlabs/openproject-reporting.git", :branch => "stable/5"`

Afterwards, run:

`bundle install`


Deinstallation
--------------

Remove the lines

`gem "reporting_engine", git: "https://github.com/finnlabs/reporting_engine.git", :branch => "dev"`
`gem "openproject-reporting", git: "https://github.com/finnlabs/openproject-reporting.git", :branch => "stable/5"`

from your `Gemfile.plugins` in your OpenProject installation folder and run:

`bundle install`

to uninstall the ReportingEngine and the OpenProject Reporting plugin.


Configuration
-------------

* `cost_reporting_cache_filter_classes: true`

OpenProject Reporting, when not configured otherwise, optimizes response time by caching the filters and group by options generated for work package custom fields. Only when the custom fields are invalidated, does reporting recreate the elements by information from the database. In some scenarios, such a behavior might not be desirable. Especially, when databases are switched between requests to serve information from another installation, caching will almost always fail as the information is outdated and in some edge cases, filters and group by options are displayed erroneously. In such a setting, it is advisible to deactivate the caching by setting `cost_reporting_cache_filter_classes` to `false` in OpenProject's `config/configuration.yml`
