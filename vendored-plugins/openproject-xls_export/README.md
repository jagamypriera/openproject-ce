# OpenProject XLS Export Plugin

Enables work package export as Excel spreadsheets (.xls). This plugin allows work package export as Excel document in the work package list.

To export work packages in the work package list, select the `Settings` menu button (gear icon) and select `Export ...` from the dropdown menu.
Choose either `XLS` or `XLS with descriptions` (to export the work package list with the work package descriptions) to export the work packages shown in the work package list.


Requirements
------------

The OpenProject XLS-Export plugin requires the [OpenProject Core](https://github.com/opf/openproject/) to be in the same version as the plugin.

Installation
------------

To install the OpenProject XLS-Export plugin you need to add the following line to the `Gemfile.plugins` in your OpenProject folder (if you use a different OpenProject version than OpenProject 5, adapt `:branch => "stable/5"` to your OpenProject version):

`gem "openproject-xls_export", git: "https://github.com/finnlabs/openproject-xls_export.git", :branch => "stable/5"`

Afterwards, run:

`bundle install`

Deinstallation
--------------

Remove the line

`gem "openproject-xls_export", git: "https://github.com/finnlabs/openproject-xls_export.git", :branch => "stable/5"`

from the file `Gemfile.plugins` and run:

`bundle install`

Configuration
-------------

The plugin adds 3 export formats to the work package index. They are all enabled by default.
However, they can be disabled via the OpenProject configuration (`configuration.yml`):

```
  default:
    xls_export:
      disabled_formats:
        - xls
        - xls_with_descriptions
        - xls_with_relations
```
