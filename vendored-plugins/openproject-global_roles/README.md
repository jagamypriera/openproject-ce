OpenProject Global Roles Plugin
==========================

This plugin adds global roles to [OpenProject](https://www.openproject.org).
A user can have a global role allowing to perform actions outside of the scope
of a specific project normally only allowed for administrators.
By assigning the permission to create projects to a global role,
non-administrators can create top-level projects.

To create a global role, go to the Administration view, select "Roles and permissions"
and click on "New Role". Afterwards, select the checkbox "Global Role" and choose the
permissions for this role. From the plugin, only "Create project" is available.
However, there are other plugins adding more permissions to be assigned to global
roles.

The created global roles can be assigned to individual users in the added "Global Roles"
tab of the user settings.

Requirements
------------

The Global Roles plugin currently requires the [OpenProject Core](https://github.com/opf/openproject/) in
version 3.0.0 or newer.


Installation
------------

For OpenProject Global Roles itself you need to add the following line to the `Gemfile.plugins` of OpenProject (if you use a different OpenProject version than OpenProject 5, adapt `:branch => "stable/5"` to your OpenProject version):

`gem "openproject-global_roles", git: "https://github.com/finnlabs/openproject-global_roles.git", :branch => "stable/5"`

Afterwards, run:

`bundle install`

This plugin contains migrations. To migrate the database, run:

`rake db:migrate`

Deinstallation
--------------

Currently, a complete automatic uninstall is not supported.
Before the plugin can be removed, all global roles have to be deleted.
Afterwards, remove the line

`gem "openproject-global_roles", git: "https://github.com/finnlabs/openproject-global_roles.git", :branch => "stable/5"`

from the file `Gemfile.plugins` and run:

`bundle install`

Please not that this changes by the plugin in the database. Currently, we do not
support full uninstall of the plugin.
