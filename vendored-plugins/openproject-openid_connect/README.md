# OpenProject OpenID Connect Plugin

Adds support for OmniAuth OpenID Connect strategy providers, most importantly Google.

## Dependencies

You will have to add the following lines to your OpenProject's `Gemfile.plugins` for the time being (omit aleady existing ones):
```ruby
    gem "openproject-auth_plugins", :git => 'git@github.com:finnlabs/openproject-auth_plugins', :branch => 'dev'
    gem 'omniauth-openid-connect', :git => 'git@github.com:finnlabs/omniauth-openid-connect.git', :branch => 'dev'
    gem 'omniauth-openid_connect-providers', :git => 'git@github.com:finnlabs/omniauth-openid_connect-providers.git', :branch => 'dev'
    gem 'openproject-openid_connect', :git => 'git@github.com:finnlabs/openproject-openid_connect.git', :branch => 'dev'

    gem 'lobby_boy', :git => 'git@github.com:finnlabs/lobby_boy.git', :branch => 'dev'
```

### Development

If you want to run the tests you will have add the following as well:
```ruby
    group :test do
  	  gem 'rspec-steps', '~> 0.4.0'
  	end
```

## Configuration

The provider configuration can be either done in `configuration.yml` or within the settings.

### `configuration.yml`

Example configuration:
```yaml
default:
  openid_connect:
    google:
      identifier: "9295222hfbiu2btgu3b4i.apps.googleusercontent.com"
      secret: "4z389thugh334t8h"
      icon: "openid_connect/auth_provider-google.png"
      display_name: "Google"
```
The last two attributes are commonly available for all providers. They are used to change a provider's look.
To grab corresponding values from ENV (eg. on heroku) do it this way:
```yaml
default:
  ...
  openid_connect:
    google:
      identifier: <%= ENV['GOGLE_CLIENT_ID'] %>
      secret: <%= ENV['GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET'] %>
      ...
```

The key `google` here can be chosen freely. Using `google`, however, will automatically use
a set of custom options necessary for the authentication to work with Google specifically.
If use any other identifier you may have to configure these options yourself.
Check out [omniauth-openid_connect-providers](https://github.com/finnlabs/omniauth-openid_connect-providers/tree/dev/lib/omniauth/openid_connect) if you want more details.

If you want to configure several different google accounts you can do so by using "google." as a
prefix for different identifiers. E.g. `google.gmail` and `google.company`.

Note that currently there are only two custom provider icons this plugin has out of the box (for supported providers):

* `openid_connect/auth_provider-google.png`
* `openid_connect/auth_provider-heroku.png`

Other icons you will have to add yourself which usually involves writing an own plugin.
<small>FIXME: Elaborate on this a bit as it is unclear how and where they should be added</small>

`display_name` changes a provider's label shown to the user.

Remember that you can also define or override the configuration using ENV vars only, i.e. without
having to touch the `configuration.yml` at all.
The configuration above in ENV vars would look like this:

```
OPENPROJECT_OPENID__CONNECT_GOOGLE_IDENTIFIER=9295222hfbiu2btgu3b4i.apps.googleusercontent.com
OPENPROJECT_OPENID__CONNECT_GOOGLE_SECRET=4z389thugh334t8h
OPENPROJECT_OPENID__CONNECT_GOOGLE_DISPLAY__NAME=Google
OPENPROJECT_OPENID__CONNECT_GOOGLE_ICON=openid_connect/auth_provider-google.png
```

### Single Sign-On

This plugin supports OpenID Connect Session Management. To setup a provider for SSO
you have to configure the following additional options for the provider:

```yaml
# example settings for openproject.com
sso: true
issuer: 'https://login.openproject.com'
discovery: false
end_session_endpoint: '/auth/end_session'
check_session_iframe: '/auth/check_session'
```

### Settings

There is no UI for the settings just yet. One way to set them until then is the rails console:
```ruby
    Setting["plugin_openproject_openid_connect"] = {
      "providers" => {
        "google" => {
          "identifier" => "9295222hfbiu2btgu3b4i.apps.googleusercontent.com",
          "secret" => "4z389thugh334t8h"
        },
        "heroku" => {
          "identifier" => "foobar",
          "secret" => "baz"
        }
      }
    }
```

While Google and Heroku are pre-defined you can add arbitrary providers through configuration.
Those may then require the host and/or endpoints to be specified depending on whether or not a particular provider adheres to the default endpoint paths.
```ruby
    Setting["plugin_openproject_openid_connect"] = {
      "providers" => {
        "myprovider" => {
          "host" => "login.myprovider.net",
          "identifier" => "9295222hfbiu2btgu3b4i.apps.googleusercontent.com",
          "secret" => "4z389thugh334t8h"
        },
        "yourprovider" => {
          "identifier" => "foobar",
          "secret" => "baz",
          "authorization_endpoint" => "https://auth.yourprovider.com/oauth2/authorize"
  		  "token_endpoint" => "https://auth.yourprovider.com/oauth2/token?api-version=1.0"
  		  "userinfo_endpoint" => "https://users.yourprovider.com/me"
        },
        "theirprovider" => {
          "identifier" => "foobar",
          "secret" => "baz",
          "host" => "signin.theirprovider.co.uk",
          "authorization_endpoint" => "/oauth2/authorization/new"
  		  "token_endpoint" => "/oauth2/tokens"
  		  "userinfo_endpoint" => "/oauth2/users/me"
        }
      }
    }
```

If a host is given, relative endpoint paths will refer to said host.
No host is required if absolute endpoint URIs are given.

The configuration of the pre-defined providers (currently Google and Heroku) can be overriden as well.

## Provider Client Registration

Client ID and secret are often provided by the provider, otherwise refer to the provider on how to create them.

Use the following scheme for creating a callback URL (you have to whitelist that URL at the provider):

    https://YOURAPP.example.org/auth/PROVIDER_NAME/callback

Replace `PROVIDER_NAME` with the key you used for the provider in the settings hash. So e.g. for an app running on openproject.example.org and authentication via Google, you can set up the following callback URL:

    https://openproject.example.org/auth/google/callback

## Provider SSL certificate validation

This plugin uses OpenSSL's default certificate store (on Linux you can ususally find it in `/etc/ssl/certs`).

If you want to use a different list of CAs for validating provider SSL certificates, you can set the environment variable `SSL_CERT_DIR` to another path containing CA certificates. Note that this environment variable is an OpenSSL feature, so it changes the CA list for all libraries using OpenSSL that don't explicitly specify another path.
